We quite often need to calculate something in a program, such as an average or a sum. The solution pattern to solve such problems is as follows.

    Define the inputs required for the calculation and declare variables for them. Input refers to the values used in the calculation. You can typically identify the type of inputs from the problem description.
    Identify the operation needed, and declare a variable for the result of the calculation. Perform the calculation using the inputs, and assign the result to the variable that was reserved for it. The type of the result can also usually be identified from the problem description.
    Once the calculation is done, do something with its result. This can mean printing the result of a computation, or, for example, using it in calculating an average by dividing a sum of the inputs by their count.
